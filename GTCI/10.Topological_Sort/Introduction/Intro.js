// Introduction 

// Topological sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For example, if event "B" is dependent of event "A", "A" comes before "A" in topological order

// This pattern defines an easy way to understand the technique for performing topological sorting of a set of elements and then solves a few problems using it
