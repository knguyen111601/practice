// Introduction 

// This pattern is based on the Depth First Search (DFS) technique to traverse a tree

// We will be using recursion (or we can also use a stack for the iterative approach) to keep track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing

// The Space Complexity will be O(H) where H is the max height of the tree
