// Introduction

// This pattern is based on the Breadth First Search (BFS) technique to traverse a tree

// Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using this approach 
// We will use a Queue to keep track of all the nodes of a level before we jump onto the next level

// Space Complexity will be O(W) where W is the maximum number of nodes on any level
